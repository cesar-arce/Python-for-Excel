# Python_for_Excel
Integrate Excel and Python and get the best of two Worlds! Python Beginners welcome. Use Pandas, Seaborn &amp; co. in Excel

Excel vs. Python - what is the best tool for Data Science, Business and Finance?

The answer is: Use Excel and Python together and integrate both tools with xlwings. Get the best of two worlds!



With xlwings, you can use Python Data Science libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scikit-learn directly in Excel! You can run Python code in Excel and boost your Excel projects! More and more Professionals and Developers use

Excel as Frontend

Python as analytical Backend.  



This course is the perfect choice for

Experienced Python Coders: Use Excel as Graphical User Interphase (GUI) | Run your Python scripts with Excel | Present your results with Excel Dashboards 

Excel Users and complete Python Beginners: Boost your Excel projects with clean and powerful Python code!

Mixed Groups: Non-Coders can run and use Python code simply by clicking on buttons in Excel.



Why use Excel?

There is no better Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Reporting tool than Excel. Excel is

widely spread (750 million users)

standardized

intuitive to use

most users are well-trained

it requires low/zero set up

it requires low/zero maintenance  

and it´s still the best choice for financial models & spreadsheet calculations



Why use Python?

With hundreds of powerful Libraries, Python is the first choice for Data Science, Machine Learning and advanced analytics in Business and Finance. The Python Ecosystem is way more powerful and versatile than VBA. And it´s cleaner and easier to learn and apply!



Why use and master xlwings?

xlwings is the perfect tool to integrate Excel and Python! xlwings allows you to

Automate Excel from Python e.g. to produce reports or to interact with Jupyter Notebooks.

Write macros in Python that you can run from buttons in Excel, e.g. to load in data from a database or an external API.

Write UDFs (user-defined functions) and leverage the power from NumPy, Pandas and machine learning libraries.

Leverage Python's scientific stack for interactive data analysis using Jupyter Notebooks, NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, etc.

Use xlwings to automate Excel reports with Python.

Write Excel tools with Python instead of VBA and call your code directly from within Excel, e.g. via a button on the sheet.

This also works great for prototyping web apps.

Write (array) UDFs in a breeze by taking advantage of all the functionality already available in libraries like NumPy and Pandas.

Dynamic array formulas are supported.
